Feeling–Energy–Modulation Model

Proposed by: Aki Hirvilammi (2025)
Affective Information Framework Across Media
Core Statement

“Feeling is the message; energy is the envelope; modulation is the content.”

This triadic formulation is proposed as a universal model for human communication and expression across auditory, visual, textual, and spatial modalities.
Mapping to Established Theory

1. Feeling = Message / Payload
- Roman Jakobson (1960) defined the emotive function of language as conveying the speaker’s affect.
- Gregory Bateson described information as a “difference that makes a difference.”
- In this model, the payload of communication is feeling—the affective meaning intended or received.

2. Energy = Envelope / Carrier
- In signal theory, a carrier wave transports information; the amplitude envelope often determines intelligibility (especially in speech).
- McLuhan’s dictum “the medium is the message” emphasized the structural role of media, but did not tie medium explicitly to physical energy.
- Here, energy (air pressure, light, ink, pigment, etc.) is the material substrate—the envelope that bears modulation.

3. Modulation = Content / Form
- In engineering, modulation (AM, FM, PM) is how a baseband signal is imprinted onto a carrier.
- In art and semiotics, form or structure organizes meaning.
- This model identifies modulation as the shaping of energy into recognizable patterns—letters, rhythms, brushstrokes, or frequencies—that embody content.
Dynamic and Stationary Media

- Dynamic media (music, speech, film): Energy is time-varying; modulation occurs through rhythm, frequency, amplitude changes.
- Stationary media (writing, painting, architecture): Energy is spatially arranged; modulation occurs in form and structure fixed in time.
- In both cases, the feeling transmitted remains the true payload.
Comparison With Existing Aphorisms

- “Sound is the key; frequency is the code.” → Technical, vibration-centered, limited to oscillatory carriers.
- “Feeling is the message; energy is the envelope; modulation is the content.” → Human-centered, multi-modal, bridges both stationary and dynamic carriers.
Novelty

- No prior literature explicitly articulates this triad across modalities.
- Closest precedents: Shannon–Weaver model (information theory), McLuhan (medium theory), Jakobson (language functions), Bateson (information as difference).
- The novelty lies in unifying these perspectives into an affect-centric, energy-structured, modulation-driven framework applicable to both temporal and spatial communication.
