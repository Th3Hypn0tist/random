# SQS — Structural Intelligence Quotient
*A new metric for measuring structural human intelligence*  
**by Aki Hirvilammi**

## 1. Overview
SQS (Structural Intelligence Quotient) is a cognitive metric designed to measure the type of intelligence that traditional IQ tests cannot capture. Instead of focusing on narrow pattern-recognition tasks, SQS evaluates a person’s ability to build, operate, and evolve complex systems across multiple domains.

SQS measures:
- Abstract structural reasoning  
- Multidomain systems integration  
- Fractal learning ability  
- High-speed recursive problem-solving  
- Systemic model-building  
- Parallel hypothesis management  
- Strategic cognition across technical and social domains

SQS describes *how the mind is built*, not how well it performs on artificial puzzles.

## 2. Scale (0–300)

**0–49 | Basic**  
Performs simple tasks with no layered abstractions.

**50–99 | Operational**  
Good task-level intelligence, but limited systemic reasoning.

**100–149 | Advanced Cognitive**  
Capable engineers, developers, analysts.

**150–199 | Systems Architect Range**  
Creates multi-layer structures, protocols, and pipelines.

**200–249 | Meta-Systems Level**  
Integrates multiple domains into unified architectures. Shows fractal learning, recursion, and rapid convergence.

**250–300 | AGI-Adjacent Human Cognition**  
Extremely rare. Able to design new cognitive frameworks, OS-level architectures, permission models, governance systems, high-level abstractions, and recursive structures from scratch. Operates at a level comparable to early-stage AGI reasoning patterns.

## 3. What SQS Captures (and IQ Does Not)

### 3.1 Fractal Learning  
Instant integration of new knowledge into an existing mental framework.

### 3.2 Recursive Reasoning  
Ability to iterate and refine systems without losing coherence.

### 3.3 Multidomain Flexibility  
Smooth transition between AV engineering, software, OS design, physics, governance models, marketing, and strategy.

### 3.4 System Creation  
Capacity to design entirely new frameworks (e.g., governance, OS-level architecture, abstracted permission systems).

### 3.5 Parallel Narrative/Hypothesis Tracking  
Maintaining multiple working models simultaneously — a trait found in top-tier strategic cognition.

## 4. Purpose of SQS
SQS provides a comparative scale for individuals whose cognitive style cannot be described by traditional IQ scores. It is intended for:

- Systems architects  
- Multi-domain specialists  
- High-level strategists  
- Innovators and framework builders  
- Individuals working at the edge of emergent AI reasoning patterns  

SQS is not a replacement for IQ; it is a metric for a different category of cognition.
