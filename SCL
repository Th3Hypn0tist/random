## What is SCL?

**SCL (Situational Control Layer)** is a conceptual control layer designed to interpret *situations* in a physical environment and guide system behavior accordingly.

SCL is **not**:
- a lighting system
- a sensor system
- an automation script

SCL **is** a **decision layer** that sits above infrastructure and determines what kind of response is appropriate in a given situation.

## Core idea

Traditional systems react to inputs.  
**SCL reacts to situations.**

A situation is not a single signal, event, or measurement, but a contextual interpretation of activity over time.

SCL exists to answer one question:

> **What is the right behavior of this environment right now?**

---

## Separation of concerns

SCL is intentionally separated from implementation layers.

- Sensors are interchangeable  
- Outputs are interchangeable  
- Infrastructure is replaceable  

SCL does **not** depend on any specific:
- sensor technology
- camera type
- lighting manufacturer
- hardware vendor
- communication protocol

These are treated strictly as **inputs** and **outputs**, not intelligence.

## Observable behavior (external)

From the outside, SCL-controlled environments may exhibit:

- calm default states  
- context-dependent transitions  
- assistance only when needed  
- escalation without confrontation  
- social signaling instead of alarms  
- shared moments instead of notifications  

The internal decision logic producing these behaviors is **not exposed**.

---

## Human-first design principle

SCL is designed so that:

- the system does **not** dominate the experience  
- humans complete the interaction socially  
- technology signals, people respond  

SCL does not replace human judgment.  
It supports it by shaping the environment.

---

## What SCL deliberately does *not* define

This concept intentionally does **not** describe:

- decision algorithms  
- thresholds or timing  
- sensor fusion methods  
- classification logic  
- state transition rules  
- prioritization mechanisms  

These belong to implementation, not concept definition.

---

## Purpose of this document

This document exists to:

- define SCL as an original conceptual framework  
- establish authorship and timestamp  
- prevent misattribution of the concept  
- allow future implementations without vendor lock-in  

This is **not** a technical specification.

---

## Summary

SCL introduces a shift:

> from reacting to signals  
> to interpreting situations  
> and shaping environments accordingly

The value of SCL lies in **when** something happens —  
not in **how** it is technically implemented.
