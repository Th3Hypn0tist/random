## 🧠 Interpretation
This verification demonstrates that the 2024 projection was **not speculative but mechanistic**—based on the cumulative stress of:

- Persistent structural unemployment  
- Debt-driven consumption and credit contraction  
- Public sector over-extension → fiscal retrenchment  
- Collapse of confidence in both private and state institutions
